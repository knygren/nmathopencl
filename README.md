glmbayes provides independent and identically distributed (iid) samples for Bayesian Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).
Its primary interface, glmb(), serves as a Bayesian analogue to R's glm() function, supporting Gaussian, Poisson,
Binomial, and Gamma families under log-concave likelihoods. Sampling for most models is performed using accept-reject
methods based on likelihood subgradients (Nygren and Nygren, 2006). For Gaussian models, the package also includes
lmb(), a Bayesian counterpart to R's lm().

The package includes a rich set of supporting tools for prior specification, model diagnostics, and method functions
that mirror those for lm() and glm(). Most functions are extensively documented, and a comprehensive set of vignettes
are available to guide users through the package's capabilities.

The package is currently available on R-Universe, with plans for a future CRAN submission. For recent updates and planned enhancements, see

## Installation

To install the current development version (excluding OpenCL functionality):

install.packages("glmbayes",
                 repos = c("https://knygren.r-universe.dev",
                           "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

To install a version suitable for large models with GPU acceleration, follow the instructions from 

**Chapter 12 - Large Models: GPU Acceleration using OpenCL**
https://knygren.r-universe.dev/articles/glmbayes/Chapter-12.html

## Minimal Working Example

    library(glmbayes)

    # Dobson (1990), p. 93: Randomized Controlled Trial
    counts <- c(18,17,15,20,10,20,25,13,12)
    outcome <- gl(3,1,9)
    treatment <- gl(3,3)
    print(d.AD <- data.frame(treatment, outcome, counts))

    ## Classical glm
    glm.D93 <- glm(counts ~ outcome + treatment,
                   family = poisson())

    ## Bayesian glmb
    # Step 1: Set up prior
    ps <- Prior_Setup(counts ~ outcome + treatment, family = poisson())
    mu <- ps$mu
    V  <- ps$Sigma

    # Step 2: Fit using glmb
    glmb.D93 <- glmb(counts ~ outcome + treatment,
                     family = poisson(),
                     pfamily = dNormal(mu = mu, Sigma = V))

    summary(glmb.D93)

## Supported families, links, and pfamilies

As with `glm()`, models are defined by a formula for the linear predictor and a `family()` describing the likelihood and 
link. In addition, `glmb()` requires a **pfamily** object specifying the prior.

The supported likelihood families, link functions, and compatible pfamilies are:

| Likelihood family           | Link functions                    | Compatible pfamilies                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gaussian                    | identity                           | dNormal, dGamma, dNormal_Gamma, dIndependent_Normal_Gamma |
| Poisson / Quasi-Poisson     | log                                | dNormal                                                    |
| Binomial / Quasi-Binomial   | logit, probit, cloglog             | dNormal                                                    |
| Gamma                       | log                                | dNormal, dGamma                                            |

### Prior_Setup

For a default, data‑aligned prior using the same formula and family as `glm()`, call `Prior_Setup(formula, family, data = ..., ...)`. 
The returned list includes default settings for the following:

- **mu**, **Sigma** — Zellner‑style normal prior components for use with most priors  
- **Additional Gaussian‑specific calibration components**:  
  - `dispersion` for use with the `dNormal()` prior (gaussian and Gamma families)
  - `Sigma_0`, `shape` and `rate` for use with the `dNormal_Gamma()` prior  
  - `shape_ING` and `rate` for use with `dIndependent_Normal_Gamma()` prior 
  - `shape`, `rate_gamma` and `coefficients` for use with the `dGamma()` prior  

Optional arguments adjust prior weight, centering, and related settings (see the function help and vignette Chapter 03).

### Typical Prior_Setup wiring

Assuming `ps <- Prior_Setup(...)`:

- **All non‑Gaussian families:**  
  Use `dNormal(mu = ps$mu, Sigma = ps$Sigma)`.  
  (For Gamma GLMs, also supply `dispersion` from the fitted GLM or from `ps`; see `example("glmb")`.)

- **Gaussian — normal prior with known dispersion:**  
  Use `dNormal(mu = ps$mu, Sigma = ps$Sigma, dispersion = ps$dispersion)`.

- **Gaussian — conjugate Normal–Gamma:**  
  Use `dNormal_Gamma(mu = ps$mu, Sigma_0 = ps$Sigma_0, shape = ps$shape, rate = ps$rate)`.

- **Gaussian — independent Normal–Gamma:**  
  Use `dIndependent_Normal_Gamma(mu = ps$mu, Sigma = ps$Sigma, shape = ps$shape_ING, rate = ps$rate)`.

- **Gaussian — dispersion via dGamma (coefficients fixed):**  
  With `rate_dg <- if (!is.null(ps$rate_gamma)) ps$rate_gamma else ps$rate`, use  
  `dGamma(shape = ps$shape, rate = rate_dg, beta = ps$coefficients)`.

The default priors have limiting behaviors that produce estimates resembling classical estimates as priors get weak 
(see documentation and vignettes for details).

All supported models have log‑concave likelihoods, enabling efficient iid sampling via enveloping functions
and subgradient‑based accept–reject algorithms, especially for models lacking standard iid samplers.

    example("rIndepNormalGammaReg_std")

## Methodology

For generalized linear models where well known sampling methods are unavailable, sampling follows the
framework from Nygren and Nygren (2006), using likelihood subgradients to construct enveloping functions for
the posterior distribution. When the posterior is approximately normal, the expected number of draws per
acceptance is bounded as per that paper and as discussed in our vignettes.
Dispersion can be sampled via `rGamma_reg()` (standalone) or jointly with coefficients via
`rNormalGamma_reg()` and `rindepNormalGamma_reg()`.

## GPU Acceleration Using OpenCL

The implemented algorithms tend to have acceptable performance on CPUs up to around 10-14 dimensions.
For larger models, the envelope construction is embarrassingly parallel. To accelerate envelope construction
in such cases, the package provides optional GPU acceleration using OpenCL. This requires that users have
GPU enabled machines and an OpenCL installation. These features are discussed in more detail in two of
our vignettes.

Together, these vignettes form a comprehensive reference that supports users at all levels, 
from first-time Bayesian GLM users to researchers interested in the mathematical and computational
details behind the samplers.

## Feature Highlights

- S3 interface mirroring the structure of base glm()
- Accept-reject sampling for log-concave likelihoods
- Samplers for both fixed and variable dispersion
- Extensive vignettes to guide users through the package's capabilities
- Modular prior setup function

## Limitations

- Non-log-concave likelihoods are not currently supported

## Future Plans

- Full CRAN submission 
- Poisson speed (OpenCL and simulation): Precompute the log-factorial term `log(y!)`
  once per observation and reuse it in both OpenCL envelope construction and
  accept-reject simulation, since it depends only on the response, to reduce
  redundant `lgamma` evaluation and improve performance for large Poisson models.
- Grid selection (simulation): Precompute cumulative PLSD and use inverse CDF
  sampling (e.g. binary search) to select the grid component per candidate
  instead of scanning PLSD, improving the simulation loop when many candidates
  are evaluated.
